                    Automobile Engineering
This course caters to train the students to design, develop, manufacture, and repair of automobiles. The demand for automobile engineering is growing with the expansion of automobile industries and increasing demand for vehicle. With increasing concern for pollution and fuel efficiency, these engineers also set standard of qualities, for example making the vehicle Euro efficient. The field of activity of a qualified engineer in automobile engineering contains development (construction, calculation and testing), priming of work, fabrication and observation of the functionality of vehicles for street and rails. The engineers of automobile engineering have to develop car bodies and buildups with aggregates like engines, clutches, gears and steering. They have to design according the postulations of aerodynamics and stylistics, they have to construct and calculate according the postulations of functionality, safety, the dreading of resources and the economy. According the priority of the study the engineer gets activities as an engineer for development, running and maintenance in commercial and special vehicles or motors and transmissions. Students have employment Opportunity in Automobile manufacturing Industry, in maintenance and service stations, private transport company and Defense Services. Self-employment is also possible in setting up automobile garages or maintenance workshop.
