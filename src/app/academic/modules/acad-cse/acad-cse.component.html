                <h2>Computer Engineering</h2>
                <p>Computer science engineering is, undoubtedly, one of the most sought after specialised courses nowadays. This is a technical degree below the undergraduate rank which aims to provide students with some basic knowledge of engineering, scientific, computing etc. Today's world is highly dependent on computer systems that are fast, up-to-date, and secure. Due to the wide use of computers across industries and applications, we find a great demand for computer engineers in many diverse areas. The computer engineering branch has two main areas- hardware engineering and software engineering. A computer software engineer specializes in computer software applications and computer software systems. After analysing users' needs, he or she designs, tests, constructs and maintain programs to meet them. Computer software engineers design and develop computer and video games, business applications and operating systems. Hardware engineers are responsible for designing, developing, and testing computer hardware, including computer systems, circuit boards, computer chips, keyboards, routers, and printers. They supervise the manufacturing, production, and installation of the parts. The course curriculum of diploma in computer engineering is designed with the aim to develop these skills in students. The scheme include a wide range of subjects ranging from core basic hardware and software courses to the recent trends in technology such as ethical hacking , smart device programming etc.
